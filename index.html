							<h3>Buy n Sell(Auction House)</h3>
							<p>For my semester project, I integrated an API developed by students at Noroff (see Noroff API Documentation). My focus was on the Auction House section, which aligned with the nature of my project. I utilized Figma for designing the layout and aesthetics of my website, ensuring a visually appealing interface. The site, named “Buy & Sell: Auction House,” was launched using Netlify, featuring a custom logo designed via logo.com to enhance brand identity. The website's color scheme centered around a blue theme with a white background, chosen for its clean and coherent visual appeal. For the development, I employed React for programming, supplemented by Tailwind as the styling framework. This combination facilitated an efficient and responsive design process. The structure of the website was comprehensive, encompassing six distinct pages: a homepage, profile page, listing page, listing ID page, along with login and registration pages. To streamline the functionality, I created specific components for each data-fetching operation and tailored the code to suit the needs of each individual page.<br><br>

								The navbar of my website serves as the main navigation tool. It's built using React, with state management for menu visibility and user information like username, credits, and avatar. Initially, the navbar checks if a user is logged in by looking for an access token in local storage. If found, it also retrieves the user's name, credits, and avatar. The navbar has a dynamic design – for larger screens, it shows user information and navigation links directly, while for smaller screens, a hamburger menu icon appears for compact navigation. The logout function clears the user's data from storage, ensuring a secure sign-out process.<br><br>
								
								The Footer is simpler but equally important. It's designed with a consistent blue background and includes the company logo. For social engagement, icons for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are provided, each linking to the respective social media pages. The Footer also displays a copyright notice, ensuring the intellectual property of the Auction House Ridwan H. Mohamud website is protected. This section effectively rounds off the website, providing essential links and information in a clean and accessible manner.<br><br>
								
								The Home page of our website is where users can view all the latest auction listings. Right when you enter the page, it automatically shows you a list of the newest items up for auction. We've made sure that this list updates on its own, so you always see the most current offerings. There's also a handy search bar at the top. This lets you quickly find exactly what you're looking for by typing in keywords. As you type, the page will only show listings that match your search, making it really easy to find interesting items. The auction listings are displayed in a neat and easy-to-read format. Each listing has a picture, the title of the item, when the auction ends, and how many bids it has received. We've designed it so that you can see all the important info at a glance. Plus, if you want to know more about a specific item, just click on its listing, and you'll be taken to a page with all the details. Overall, the Home page is straightforward and user-friendly, designed to give you a quick and enjoyable browsing experience.<br><br>
								
								On the Listing Page, users can easily create their own auction listings. It's a straightforward form where you can enter details like the item's title, description, and when the auction should end. You can also add tags and pictures. Once you submit your listing, it gets added to the auction site. We've made sure this process is simple and user-friendly, so you can focus on what you're selling, not how to list it.<br><br>
								
								The Listing ID Page is where the action happens for a specific auction item. When you visit this page, you'll see everything about that item - pictures, description, when the auction ends, and the current highest bid. If you're interested, you can place your own bid. The page makes sure your bid is valid and within your budget. It's designed to be engaging and interactive, making the bidding process exciting and straightforward.<br><br>
								
								Our Profile Page is a personal dashboard for users on the auction site. When you go to your profile, you'll see the username, how many credits you have, and the profile picture. It's a quick way to check your details at a glance. There's a feature to change your profile picture too. Just click a button, put in a new picture URL, and voila, your avatar changes! The page also lists all the items you're auctioning. You can see each item's photo, title, how long the auction runs, and the number of bids it has. It's really handy for keeping track of what you're selling. Overall, the Profile Page is made to be easy and convenient, letting you manage your auctions and personal info without any hassle.<br><br>
								
								Upon visiting the Login Page, users are greeted with a welcoming interface, prominently featuring our logo, setting a professional yet approachable tone. This page is meticulously designed to facilitate a smooth and effortless login experience. Users can easily enter their email and password in the designated fields. The process is intuitive, mirroring the simplicity and efficiency we strive for throughout our site. In case of any login issues, such as an incorrect password or email, the page is programmed to provide immediate and clear feedback. This feature is particularly appreciated by our users, as it minimizes confusion and helps them correct their entries quickly. Upon successful authentication, a friendly notification appears, confirming the successful login and signaling a seamless transition to the home page. This efficient feedback loop ensures a frustration-free user experience.<br><br>
								
								The Registration Page serves as the welcoming gateway for new users. Its layout is thoughtfully arranged to ensure a hassle-free sign-up process. New users are asked to provide essential details such as their name, a personal avatar URL, email address, and password. Each field is designed to guide the user through the process, with validations in place to ensure the security and integrity of user information. Our commitment to user security is evident in the page's functionality. It actively checks the strength and validity of the password and the format of the email address, ensuring adherence to our security standards. Should there be any discrepancies or issues, the page immediately alerts the user, providing guidance to rectify the situation. Upon successful registration, users receive a confirmation message, a small yet significant detail that enhances user satisfaction. This message not only acknowledges the completion of the registration process but also serves as a transitional guide.</p>

							<h3>Online sience Museum</h3>
							<p>For my first project, I completed a school assignment that served as the final for the semester, creating a website for an online science museum. This project required applying everything we had learned, from designing with Figma to coding with HTML and CSS, while following a Gantt chart or Trello for project management.<br><br>
								Targeting kids and young adults, I designed the website with fresh, vibrant colors. The main theme was a black-pink linear gradient, used in the header and footer. The home page features an eye-catching hero image, followed by a colorful introduction to the museum. Special events and exhibitions are highlighted first, with each card uniquely colored to stand out.<br><br>
								The menu page leads to four sections, each functioning as buttons to other pages. The explore pages mirror the home page's colorful card concept. The contact and about pages use colorful cards without images, providing information on location, hours, and admission, with a similar approach on the get involved page.<br><br>
								Interactive elements include hover effects on buttons and cards, with buttons changing color and cards altering border radius. The tickets section features a form leading to a confirmation page with a custom QR code, inspired by Oslo's MUNCH museum tickets, allowing users to access their tickets digitally.<br><br>
								This project marks the beginning of my journey, showcasing my ability to design and develop engaging, user-friendly websites.</p>
