							<h3>Holidaze (Venue renting)</h3>
							<p>Project Brief:<br><br>
								Holidaze, a newly launched accommodation booking platform, requires the development of a modern front-end for their application. The project involves creating both a customer-facing side for booking holidays and an admin-facing side for managing venues and bookings. The design and user experience are open to interpretation, but must adhere to the specified functional requirements as detailed in the API documentation.<br><br>
								Goal:<br><br>
								The objective of this project is to apply the skills acquired over the past two years to develop a comprehensive front-end application for a new accommodation booking site called Holidaze. The project aims to demonstrate the candidate's overall development capabilities, encompassing visual and technical skills, with a focus on producing a professional-grade product.<br><br>
								Requirements:<br><br>
								The project focuses solely on the front-end application, utilizing the Holidaze API. Key user stories and technical restrictions have been provided to guide the development process.<br><br>
								User Stories:<br><br>
								Users can view a list of venues.<br>
								Users can search for specific venues.<br>
								Users can view details of a specific venue.<br>
								Users can see available dates for a venue on a calendar.<br>
								Users with a stud.noroff.no email can register as customers.<br>
								Registered customers can create bookings.<br>
								Registered customers can view their upcoming bookings.<br>
								Users with a stud.noroff.no email can register as venue managers.<br>
								Registered venue managers can create, update, and delete venues.<br>
								Registered venue managers can view bookings for their venues.<br>
								Registered users can log in, update their avatar, and log out.</p>

							<h3>Buy n Sell(Auction House)</h3>
							<p><p>For my semester project, I integrated an API developed by Noroff students, focusing on the Auction House section. Using Figma, I designed the “Buy & Sell: Auction House” website, launched via Netlify with a custom logo from logo.com. The site features a blue and white color scheme for a clean visual appeal. Developed with React and styled using Tailwind, it includes six pages: homepage, profile, listing, listing ID, login, and registration. Each page has tailored components for data-fetching and functionality.<br><br>

								The navbar, built with React, manages menu visibility and user information like username, credits, and avatar. It dynamically adjusts for different screen sizes, and the logout function securely clears user data.<br><br>
								
								The Footer features a consistent blue background, company logo, and social media icons for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, along with a copyright notice.<br><br>
								
								The Home page displays the latest auction listings with an auto-updating list and a search bar. Listings include a picture, title, auction end time, and bids. Clicking on a listing shows more details.<br><br>
								
								On the Listing Page, users can create auction listings with a simple form for details, tags, and pictures.<br><br>
								
								The Listing ID Page provides all details about a specific auction item and allows users to place bids.<br><br>
								
								The Profile Page is a user dashboard displaying username, credits, and profile picture. Users can change their profile picture and view their auction items.<br><br>
								
								The Login Page has a user-friendly interface for entering email and password, with immediate feedback on login issues.<br><br>
								
								The Registration Page guides new users through sign-up, ensuring secure and valid information. Upon registration, users receive a confirmation message.</p>

							<h3>Online sience Museum</h3>
							<p>For my first project, I completed a school assignment that served as the final for the semester, creating a website for an online science museum. This project required applying everything we had learned, from designing with Figma to coding with HTML and CSS, while following a Gantt chart or Trello for project management.<br><br>
								Targeting kids and young adults, I designed the website with fresh, vibrant colors. The main theme was a black-pink linear gradient, used in the header and footer. The home page features an eye-catching hero image, followed by a colorful introduction to the museum. Special events and exhibitions are highlighted first, with each card uniquely colored to stand out.<br><br>
								The menu page leads to four sections, each functioning as buttons to other pages. The explore pages mirror the home page's colorful card concept. The contact and about pages use colorful cards without images, providing information on location, hours, and admission, with a similar approach on the get involved page.<br><br>
								Interactive elements include hover effects on buttons and cards, with buttons changing color and cards altering border radius. The tickets section features a form leading to a confirmation page with a custom QR code, inspired by Oslo's MUNCH museum tickets, allowing users to access their tickets digitally.<br><br>
								This project marks the beginning of my journey, showcasing my ability to design and develop engaging, user-friendly websites.</p>
